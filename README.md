# Aadhaar-card-Character-Recognition

This project extracts text from a picture of an Aadhar Card. It takes an image (i.e. a jpg or png file) as an argument to the command and validates if the image is an Aadhar Card or not by providing the Aadhar number from the image. It extracts information from the image like name of the card holder, date of birth or year of birth, whichever is available and the Aadhar card number.
